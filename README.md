HW #1 – FOLDER STRUCTURE & TYPOGRAPHY

Each Student must demonstrate the ability to set up a folder properly 
and include the necessary Javascript file.

The secondary focus of this assignment is typography on the web. 
Students will be given copy and a few images (related to the midterm) to work with. 
The goal is to prepare students for the midterm project by thinking about how they 
may handle typography in their project.

Each student is responsible for selecting appropriate fonts 
(using the techniques covered in class e.g. google fonts or CSS3 @font-face) 
and CSS styles to enhance the copy. Line Height, Letter Spacing, Font Weight, 
Colour and Type are the critical components of this assignment.

The text will be placed on a single provided web page (CSS Grid) 
with no other design elements other than the text and images provided.

Web files must be uploaded to GitHub following best practices taught in Authoring.
